# cldemo-vxlan

This uses reference topology.

Leaf01/Leaf02 and Leaf03/Leaf04 are configured in CLAG pairs.

vlan-aware bridging is configured.

VLAN 13 is configured as an access port to server01 and server03

VLAN 24 is configured as an access port to server02 and server04

VNI13 and VNI24 are configured between the CLAG pairs.

They are misconfigured as trunk ports carrying both vlan 13 and 24.

When a server originated broadcast packet is sent out a loop will occur between the anycast addresses, between VNIs.

It appears that a packet received on on VNI is flooded to the other VNI and looped around.

Running tcpdump on leaf03 VNI24, shows an ARP request generated by server01 in VLAN13.
